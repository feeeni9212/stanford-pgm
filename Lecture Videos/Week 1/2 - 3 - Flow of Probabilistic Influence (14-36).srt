1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,012
So we've seen reasoning patterns where
intuitively, at least that's how we argue,

2
00:00:05,012 --> 00:00:10,038
probabilistic influence kind of starts in
one node and flows through the graph on

3
00:00:10,038 --> 00:00:15,039
another node. And that might seem like,
you know, a bunch of hand waving, but it

4
00:00:15,054 --> 00:00:20,045
turns out that this is actually exactly
what goes on in a Bayesian network. So, what

5
00:00:20,045 --> 00:00:25,018
we're going to do now is we're going to make
this argument much more rigorous by trying

6
00:00:25,018 --> 00:00:29,058
to understand exactly when one variable X
can influence another variable Y, and

7
00:00:29,058 --> 00:00:33,097
we're going to start with a case where
there is no evidence going on and we're

8
00:00:33,097 --> 00:00:38,054
just asking, can variable X influence Y.
And let's look at a few simple cases. So first, if

9
00:00:38,071 --> 00:00:45,012
X and Y are connected, so say X
is a parent of Y, then, yep, pretty much

10
00:00:45,012 --> 00:00:53,000
it's pretty clear cut that X can influence
Y. If Y is a child of X, we already talked

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:59,010
about evidential reasoning. We also saw in
this case, X can influence Y, in the sense

12
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:05,021
that observing X can change my probability
distribution of Y. That's what I mean by

13
00:01:05,021 --> 00:01:16,006
influence, influence means beliefs in Y,
or about Y. More interesting are the

14
00:01:16,006 --> 00:01:22,007
cases, where we have indirect influence,
between, X and Y, so, let's consider a

15
00:01:22,007 --> 00:01:28,025
case, where there is an intervening
variable, W, and, let's think about that, can X

16
00:01:28,025 --> 00:01:34,042
influence Y, via W? And, the first case of
the causal chain such as,

17
00:01:34,042 --> 00:01:39,072
for example, the one going from
Difficulty, to Letter, via Grade, and,

18
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:48,004
we've already seen, that, in this case, X
can influence Y via W in the

19
00:01:48,004 --> 00:01:54,093
example that we saw. This is exactly the
same idea, except that we're going

20
00:01:54,093 --> 00:02:01,043
evidential and as we'll see in general,
probabilistic influence is symmetrical.

21
00:02:01,043 --> 00:02:07,085
That is, if X can influence Y, Y can
influence X. And so, that's here also,

22
00:02:07,085 --> 00:02:13,019
we have probabilistic influence
[inaudible]. Okay. The third is a

23
00:02:13,019 --> 00:02:21,036
structure that looks like this. So we have
a common cause W that has two effect X and

24
00:02:21,036 --> 00:02:27,039
Y. And again, it seems to make sense that
if, we observe the value of the SAT, then,

25
00:02:27,061 --> 00:02:32,069
that changes my beliefs in the student's
intelligence, and subsequently, my

26
00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:40,020
probability distribution over their grade.
Okay, so the last and most interesting one

27
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:47,098
is this case which is the case of two
causes that have a joint effect. This

28
00:02:47,098 --> 00:02:53,051
place is also called a V structure, for
obvious reasons, because it's shaped like

29
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:58,090
a V. And [inaudible], remember, I haven't
given you any information. The question

30
00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:04,022
is, if I tell you that a student took a
class, and the class is difficult, does

31
00:03:04,022 --> 00:03:09,096
that tell me anything about the student's
intelligence? And the answer is no. And so

32
00:03:09,096 --> 00:03:15,024
this, in this case, the one and only
exception in this particular case. So then

33
00:03:15,024 --> 00:03:20,050
let's define this notion of active trail
in the context of no evidence. So a trail

34
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:25,044
in general, is a sequence of nodes that
are connected to each other by single

35
00:03:25,044 --> 00:03:30,051
edges in the graph. So X1 up to actually
we should make this XK, so as not to

36
00:03:30,051 --> 00:03:35,065
confuse with [inaudible] variables. And
the fact that these edges are undirected

37
00:03:35,065 --> 00:03:40,040
means that they can go in either
direction. So I'm not stipulating that it

38
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:46,057
goes up or down. So basically we saw that
in, that influence can flow from one

39
00:03:46,057 --> 00:03:53,007
variable to another variable, in the
graph. And what this definition basically

40
00:03:53,007 --> 00:03:59,033
says is that the, is that the, this
influence can continue to flow. So if it

41
00:03:59,033 --> 00:04:05,058
flows from one variable to the next, to
the next, to the next, to the next, that

42
00:04:05,058 --> 00:04:11,087
still defines an active trail. The only
thing that blocks an active trail is a

43
00:04:11,087 --> 00:04:17,074
V estructure because that is the one case
where we have with no influence flows as

44
00:04:17,074 --> 00:04:25,075
an example that we showed before. So this
is a block in the trail. Now let's look

45
00:04:25,075 --> 00:04:31,006
at a more interesting case, now we have
some set of observations which we're going

46
00:04:31,006 --> 00:04:36,056
to define which we're going to denote as a
set of variables Z, so now we have this

47
00:04:36,056 --> 00:04:42,000
set of variable Z and the question is when
can X influence Y given evidence about Z

48
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,031
so the first two cases are fairly straight
forward, having evidence about Z that's

49
00:04:47,031 --> 00:04:52,004
not related that's not either X or Y
doesn't change the variability of a

50
00:04:52,004 --> 00:04:57,054
variable to influence one which is not
directly connected, so here also. If x is

51
00:04:57,054 --> 00:05:03,010
directly connected to y and either of the
causal or the evidential direction if you

52
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:08,046
tell me something about one of them it can
change my beliefs about the other. Now

53
00:05:08,046 --> 00:05:13,081
let's look at these four cases that are,
the later of the cases that are the most

54
00:05:13,081 --> 00:05:19,002
interesting ones. That is one where  X can
influence Y through an intervening node W. And

55
00:05:19,002 --> 00:05:28,018
others really two cases either w is in my
evidence set z. Opps, sorry, either it's in

56
00:05:28,018 --> 00:05:37,012
my evidence set z or it's not. Now, lets
start with a case where w's not in my

57
00:05:37,012 --> 00:05:45,019
evidence case in my evidence set z. Well,
in this case, I didn't get to observe w.

58
00:05:45,019 --> 00:05:50,088
So, I'm asking whether x can influence y
via w, and there's really no difference

59
00:05:50,088 --> 00:05:56,065
between this case and the previous one.
That is, for example, difficulty can still

60
00:05:56,065 --> 00:06:03,013
influence letter via grade if grade is not
observed. So here, here, and here, we have

61
00:06:03,013 --> 00:06:09,090
exactly the same, behavior as before. That
is, the intermediate variables through

62
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:15,060
which the influence flowed was not
observed, and therefore, there's no

63
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:21,018
reason, why, While observing x can change
things. Before we go down to the final

64
00:06:21,018 --> 00:06:26,023
case, let's contrast this for these three
cases with a case where w is observed. W

65
00:06:26,023 --> 00:06:30,072
is evidence. So now let's consider for
example, this tray over here where

66
00:06:30,072 --> 00:06:35,033
difficulty influences the letter by a
grade. So this is not an edge in the

67
00:06:35,033 --> 00:06:39,064
Bayesian network, this is just
demonstrating the flow of influence on

68
00:06:39,064 --> 00:06:45,020
[inaudible] double lines. So now the
question is we know that's, that, that

69
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:50,049
observing difficulty can change my
distribution in the value of the letter.

70
00:06:50,049 --> 00:06:56,006
But what if I tell you the grade, that is
I know that a student got an A in the

71
00:06:56,006 --> 00:07:01,001
class. Now I'm telling you that the class
is really hard, does that change the

72
00:07:01,001 --> 00:07:06,043
probability of distribution of the letter?
No because we already know the student got

73
00:07:06,043 --> 00:07:11,072
an A the letter only depends on the grade
and so in this case insolence can't flow

74
00:07:11,072 --> 00:07:18,000
through grade if grade is observed, so in
this case, we have, this situation. What

75
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,075
about the evidential case? Well, we've
already talked about the fact that

76
00:07:22,075 --> 00:07:28,008
evidential, that probabilistic influence
is symmetrical. So if difficulty can't

77
00:07:28,008 --> 00:07:33,035
influence letter where grade is observed,
letter can't influence difficulty when

78
00:07:33,035 --> 00:07:39,046
grade is observed. And so once again, we
have no influence here. Finally well not

79
00:07:39,046 --> 00:07:46,078
finally but the third case is the one
where we have a common cause that has two

80
00:07:46,078 --> 00:07:54,028
effects so in this case take for example
the SAT changing my beliefs in grade via

81
00:07:54,028 --> 00:08:00,033
intelligence. And again we know we've
already seen examples in fact that the SAT

82
00:08:00,033 --> 00:08:05,041
can change the probability of
distributioning grade but if I tell you

83
00:08:05,041 --> 00:08:11,044
that the student is intelligent then, then
it doesn't, there's no way for the SAT to

84
00:08:11,044 --> 00:08:17,084
change my probability distribution in
grade. Now, I'm giving you this as sort of

85
00:08:17,084 --> 00:08:23,028
a high level intuitive argument. But it's,
it's possible, and we'll actually go

86
00:08:23,028 --> 00:08:28,093
through an argument to demonstrate that,
this is really what's going on here. And

87
00:08:28,093 --> 00:08:34,044
that these, probalistic influences
[inaudible] really do hold, in, in a graph

88
00:08:34,044 --> 00:08:40,089
such as this. Okay so let's talk about the
last and most interesting case which is

89
00:08:41,013 --> 00:08:47,066
the case where we have a V structure so
this is this case over here X and so for

90
00:08:47,066 --> 00:08:53,056
example difficulty can difficulty
insolence intelligence via grade. And if

91
00:08:53,056 --> 00:08:59,026
grade is observed, this is exactly
the case that we've seen before. This is

92
00:08:59,026 --> 00:09:05,003
the case of inter-causal reasoning or,
that, that, we demonstrated earlier. So in

93
00:09:05,003 --> 00:09:10,095
this case if W is in Z, actually we're in
the case where influence can flow, so this

94
00:09:10,095 --> 00:09:18,073
case is working in exactly the opposite to
the previous three cases. [inaudible] we

95
00:09:18,073 --> 00:09:24,054
have one tricky thing left, which is, what
happens if W is not in Z? Now, the

96
00:09:24,054 --> 00:09:30,007
main conclusion might be to say, well, you
know, if W's not observed, than it's

97
00:09:30,007 --> 00:09:35,081
exactly the same as before. And influence
can't flow, so I'm tempted to put an X

98
00:09:35,081 --> 00:09:43,036
right over here. Except, that this is not
quite right. Because what happens if I

99
00:09:43,036 --> 00:09:50,023
don't observe grade, but I actually
observe. Letter. I don't observe the grade

100
00:09:50,023 --> 00:09:55,013
directly but I observe something that
gives me a strong indication of what value

101
00:09:55,013 --> 00:10:00,083
the grade took. In this case this tool
activates the v structure. That is it

102
00:10:00,083 --> 00:10:07,014
gives me in evidence that needs to be
explained. I can explain it by difficulty

103
00:10:07,014 --> 00:10:13,094
or via intelligence and so and so that
point it establishes the connection, the

104
00:10:13,094 --> 00:10:19,069
correlation between them. So that
observing one does influence the other.

105
00:10:19,069 --> 00:10:26,001
And so this one is not actually quite
right. What you'd actually like to say is

106
00:10:26,001 --> 00:10:39,010
that if w, cause of their. So this is X
if. W and R all the way to the descendents.

107
00:10:43,008 --> 00:11:05,044
Are not observed. Or conversely that this
influences control either, if W or

108
00:11:09,003 --> 00:11:25,081
one of its descendants is observed. So
this tells us a taxonomy of how influence

109
00:11:25,081 --> 00:11:34,035
can flow through an intervening variable
and now we can take that and we can put it

110
00:11:34,035 --> 00:11:42,069
together to define an overall model, of a
more general flow of influence. So for

111
00:11:42,069 --> 00:11:55,034
example, one can influence flow from S
through I. Og into D. Well? Let's look at

112
00:11:55,034 --> 00:12:05,000
a couple cases. What if I is observed?
Well, if I is observed, then it blocks the

113
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:11,061
trail. And if it blocks the trail, you're,
you're, there's no more opportunity for it

114
00:12:11,061 --> 00:12:17,065
to flow. So that's a no. What about if I
is not observed but nothing else is

115
00:12:17,065 --> 00:12:30,035
observed? I not observed. Ignores anything
else. Well. What happens then? Well, you

116
00:12:30,035 --> 00:12:36,009
can climb up [inaudible], but you kinda
fall down the river when you hit the

117
00:12:36,009 --> 00:12:42,020
grade. And you can't climb back up, 'cause
there's nothing stopping you. And so that

118
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:54,043
two doesn't allow influence to flow. On
the other hand, if I is not observed. And

119
00:12:54,043 --> 00:13:04,036
G is observed. Well, now you can climb up
here, continue through here. Grade is

120
00:13:04,036 --> 00:13:10,020
observed so the water can kind of go back
up the hill into difficulty. So you can

121
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:16,025
think of it as a flow, sort of a flow of
water except that different nodes behave

122
00:13:16,025 --> 00:13:21,044
differently in terms of the valve
structure. So here if you observe a

123
00:13:21,044 --> 00:13:27,038
variable, it closes valves that go like
this. But if you have a V structure,

124
00:13:27,038 --> 00:13:32,082
closing this valve actually lets the water
climb back upstream, so it's kind of an

125
00:13:32,082 --> 00:13:37,086
analogy. So how do we turn this into a
formal definition? We have [inaudible]

126
00:13:37,086 --> 00:13:43,052
trail, X1 of the XN. And I have this,
should have been a K here as well. Is

127
00:13:43,052 --> 00:13:50,043
active given the if and we have two cases.
First every V structure needs to be

128
00:13:50,043 --> 00:13:57,061
activated and the only way we can activate
a V structure is if XI or one of it's

129
00:13:57,061 --> 00:14:10,008
decendants is observed. Now this is
activate. V structures. Now all the other

130
00:14:10,008 --> 00:14:18,054
valves have to be open so no other X I
that are not on these structures so X I

131
00:14:18,054 --> 00:14:23,038
not in. Whe-, whereby v, not in v
structures, I mean not at the, sort of,

132
00:14:23,038 --> 00:14:28,015
the nexus. The bottom of the v in the v
structure. No other Xi can be observed.

133
00:14:28,015 --> 00:14:33,011
And that's the definition of an active
trail. And basically what we have, is that

134
00:14:33,011 --> 00:14:36,059
influence can flow in the network through
active trails.
