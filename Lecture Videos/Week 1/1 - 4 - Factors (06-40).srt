1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,007
A critical building block in a lot of what
we'll do, both in terms of the finding

2
00:00:04,007 --> 00:00:09,007
probability distributions and in terms of
manipulating them for inference, is the

3
00:00:09,007 --> 00:00:14,007
notion of a factor. So let's define what a
factor is and the kinds of operations that

4
00:00:14,007 --> 00:00:20,007
you can do on factors. So a factor really
is a function or a table. It takes a bunch

5
00:00:20,007 --> 00:00:26,007
of arguments, in this case, a set of
random variables X1 up to Xk. And just like

6
00:00:26,007 --> 00:00:32,001
any function, it gives us a value for
every assignment to those random

7
00:00:32,001 --> 00:00:38,001
variables. So it takes all possible
assignments in the cross-product space of

8
00:00:38,001 --> 00:00:43,007
X1 up to Xk, that is all possible
combinations of assignments, and in this

9
00:00:43,007 --> 00:00:49,001
case it gives me a real value for each
such combination. And the set of

10
00:00:49,001 --> 00:00:53,005
variables X1 up to XK is called the scope
of the factor, that is, it's a set of

11
00:00:53,005 --> 00:00:58,002
arguments that the factor takes.
Let's look at some examples of factors.

12
00:00:58,002 --> 00:01:03,002
We've already seen a joint distribution.
A joint distribution is a factor. For every

13
00:01:03,002 --> 00:01:08,000
combination, for example here of the
variables I, D and G, it gives me a number.

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,004
As it happens this number is a
probability, and it happens it sums to one.

15
00:01:12,004 --> 00:01:17,003
But that doesn't matter, what's 
important is that for every value of I, D

16
00:01:17,003 --> 00:01:22,002
and G, a combination of values, I get a
number. That's why it's a factor. Here is

17
00:01:22,002 --> 00:01:28,007
a different factor: an unnormalized
measure is a factor also. In this case, we

18
00:01:28,007 --> 00:01:35,001
have a factor such as the probability of
I, D comma g1, and notice that in this case, the

19
00:01:35,001 --> 00:01:41,009
scope of a factor is actually I and D, because
there is no dependence of the factor on

20
00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:48,005
the value of the variable G, because the
variable G in this case is constant. So

21
00:01:48,005 --> 00:01:57,000
this is a factor whose scope is I and D.
Finally: a type of factor that we will use

22
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,003
extensively is what's called a Conditional
Probability Distribution, typically

23
00:02:02,003 --> 00:02:07,009
abbreviated CPD. This, as it happens, is a
CPD that's written as a table, although

24
00:02:07,009 --> 00:02:13,006
that's not necessarily the case, and this
is a CPD that gives us the conditional

25
00:02:13,006 --> 00:02:19,000
probability of the variable G given I
and D. So what does that mean? It means

26
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,004
that for every combination of values to
the variables I and D, we have a

27
00:02:24,004 --> 00:02:30,002
probability distribution over G. So, for
example, if I have an intelligent

28
00:02:30,002 --> 00:02:36,000
student in a difficult class, which is
this last line over here, this tells us

29
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,008
that the probability of getting an A is
0.5, a B, 0.3, and a C is 0.2. And as we

30
00:02:41,008 --> 00:02:47,009
can see, these numbers sum to one, as they
should, because this is a probability

31
00:02:47,009 --> 00:02:54,003
distribution over G for this particular
conditioning context. And you can easily

32
00:02:54,003 --> 00:02:59,008
verify that this is this is true for all
of the other lines in this table. So this

33
00:02:59,008 --> 00:03:05,003
is again a particular type of factor: one
that satisfies certain constraints, in this

34
00:03:05,003 --> 00:03:11,000
case, that each row sums to one. Now
this is--, these are--, the factors that we're

35
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,004
dealing with will not always correspond to
probability. So here is an example of a

36
00:03:15,004 --> 00:03:19,009
general factor that really doesn't
map in any way to probability. Because the

37
00:03:19,009 --> 00:03:24,001
numbers aren't even in the range 0...1. As
we'll see, these kinds of

38
00:03:24,001 --> 00:03:29,004
factors are nonetheless useful. This is a
factor whose scope is the set of variables

39
00:03:29,004 --> 00:03:35,001
A comma B, and it's probably using a real-valued
number for each of those, for each

40
00:03:35,001 --> 00:03:41,008
assignment to A and B. Some operations that
we're going to do on factors: One of

41
00:03:41,008 --> 00:03:47,003
the most common operations is what's
called factor product. It's taking two

42
00:03:47,003 --> 00:03:52,009
factors, say phi1 and phi2, and
multiplying them together. So, let's think

43
00:03:52,009 --> 00:03:59,002
what that means. Here we have a factor phi1.
It has a scope of A, B. phi2 has a

44
00:03:59,002 --> 00:04:05,007
scope of B, C. And what we're doing is, we're
kind of like multiplying a function.

45
00:04:05,007 --> 00:04:12,001
f of x y times g of y z: you're going to get a
function that is of all three arguments

46
00:04:12,004 --> 00:04:18,008
x, y, z. So in this case we have a factor
whose scope is A, B and C. And if we want

47
00:04:18,008 --> 00:04:23,008
to figure out, (oops, that didn't come out
good). If we wanna figure out, for example,

48
00:04:23,008 --> 00:04:28,008
value of the row a1, b1, c1, it's going to
come by taking the a1, b1 row from here,

49
00:04:28,008 --> 00:04:33,008
the b1, c1 row from here, and multiplying
them together. So we're gonna get 0.25. So

50
00:04:33,008 --> 00:04:38,009
this is effectively taking the functions
or the tables, and just multiplying them

51
00:04:38,009 --> 00:04:44,001
together. Another important operation is
factor marginalization. Factor

52
00:04:44,001 --> 00:04:49,001
marginalization is, is oh, is very similar
to, in fact identical to the

53
00:04:49,001 --> 00:04:54,001
marginalization of probability
distributions. So here we have, except

54
00:04:54,001 --> 00:04:59,008
that it doesn't have to be a probability
distribution, so for example, if we have a

55
00:04:59,008 --> 00:05:06,008
factor here who's scope is A, B, and C.
And we want to marginalize out B, to get a

56
00:05:06,008 --> 00:05:12,004
factor whose scope is A, C: what we're going
to be doing is, again, taking both possible

57
00:05:12,004 --> 00:05:17,003
values of B, in this case there's on-
because B is binary there's only two

58
00:05:17,003 --> 00:05:23,001
values, and we add them up, in order to get
the entry for a1, c1: so 0.25 plus 0.08.

59
00:05:23,001 --> 00:05:28,005
And the same all the other rows in
this table are acquired, are computed in

60
00:05:28,005 --> 00:05:33,002
exactly the same way from the
corresponding rows in the original larger

61
00:05:33,002 --> 00:05:39,003
factor. Finally, factor reduction. Again
very similar to the context of probability

62
00:05:39,003 --> 00:05:44,002
distributions. You want to reduce, for
example, to the context c1. So we're

63
00:05:44,002 --> 00:05:49,006
going to only focus on the rows that have
the value C=c1. And that's going to give

64
00:05:49,006 --> 00:05:56,008
us the reduced factor which only has C1.
And once again, the scope of this factor is

65
00:05:56,008 --> 00:06:02,005
A, B, because there is no longer any
dependence on C. So that's basically the

66
00:06:02,005 --> 00:06:07,004
final operation. Now, why factors? It
turns out that factors are the fundamental

67
00:06:07,004 --> 00:06:11,002
building block in defining these
distributions in high-dimensional spaces.

68
00:06:11,002 --> 00:06:15,006
That is, the way in which we're going to
define an exponentially large probability

69
00:06:15,006 --> 00:06:20,001
distribution over n random variables,
is by taking a bunch of little pieces and

70
00:06:20,001 --> 00:06:24,002
putting them together by multiplying
factors, in order to define this

71
00:06:24,002 --> 00:06:28,006
high-dimensional probability distribution.
It turns out, also, that the same set of

72
00:06:28,006 --> 00:06:33,000
basic operations that we use to define the
probability distributions in these

73
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,007
high-dimensional spaces are also what we use
for manipulating them, in order to give us

74
00:06:37,007 --> 00:06:40,002
a set of basic inference algorithms.
