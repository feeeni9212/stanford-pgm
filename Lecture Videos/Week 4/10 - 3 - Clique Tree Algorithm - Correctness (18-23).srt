1
00:00:01,065 --> 00:00:05,083
We define the belief propagation algorithm
with a message passing algorithm over a

2
00:00:05,083 --> 00:00:09,071
fairly general data structure called a
cluster graph. And we show that if the

3
00:00:09,071 --> 00:00:13,064
different cluster graph has certain
properties so does the belief propagation

4
00:00:13,064 --> 00:00:18,002
algorithm. What we're going to do now, is
we're going to look at a special case of

5
00:00:18,002 --> 00:00:22,049
the belief propagation algorithm, where we
pass messages not over a general cluster

6
00:00:22,049 --> 00:00:26,085
graph, but rather over a data structure
called a clique tree, which as we'll show,

7
00:00:26,085 --> 00:00:31,032
is a special case of a cluster graph. But,
interestingly, when we pass messages over a

8
00:00:31,032 --> 00:00:35,068
clique tree, we can show that the belief
propagation algorithm has much stronger

9
00:00:35,068 --> 00:00:39,093
performance guarantee than it does over
the general graph. And, specifically, we

10
00:00:39,093 --> 00:00:43,097
can show that not only can we get
convergence much faster, we can also get

11
00:00:43,097 --> 00:00:49,048
convergence to the exact answers for
probabilistic inference. So let's

12
00:00:49,048 --> 00:00:55,035
consider the case of passing messages.
Tree and lets, I'll start with the

13
00:00:55,035 --> 00:01:00,054
simplest kind of tree which is just a
chain. So in this case we have a chain

14
00:01:00,054 --> 00:01:06,065
A-B-C-D-E and we're going to assume that
this is an undirected MRF or CRF and so we

15
00:01:06,065 --> 00:01:11,078
have a, and for simplicity we're only
going to consider the pairwise potential

16
00:01:11,078 --> 00:01:16,098
without loss of generality, and so we're
going to have just, pairwise potentials

17
00:01:17,017 --> 00:01:22,043
here, that, for example, in the cluster AB
we're going to have the, the pairwise

18
00:01:22,043 --> 00:01:29,045
belief over, the pairwise potential over
AB and so on. So, so here we have psi 1,

19
00:01:29,045 --> 00:01:38,012
Psi 2. Psi 3. Psi 4. So now let's
think about the message passing process.

20
00:01:38,012 --> 00:01:44,015
And we're going to start passing messages
from the left and so psi, so cluster the

21
00:01:44,015 --> 00:01:50,018
message to cluster to and since there's no
incoming messages at this point, the

22
00:01:50,018 --> 00:01:55,092
message that's get, that gets passed is
simply the sum over A of psi 1 of AB.

23
00:01:55,092 --> 00:02:01,094
And that's a message whose scope is B. Now
we're going to have cluster two take that

24
00:02:01,094 --> 00:02:07,033
message and pass the message to cluster
three. And so now it's taking its own

25
00:02:07,033 --> 00:02:13,015
potential, psi 2, and multiplying
in this message into this. And the result

26
00:02:13,015 --> 00:02:19,018
is a factor over B and C. And we're going
to sum out over B, because, we only want

27
00:02:19,018 --> 00:02:24,078
to restrict to the scope C which is the
shared scope between cluster two and

28
00:02:24,078 --> 00:02:32,003
cluster three. And so delta 2-3 is this
message over here. Now we're going to pass

29
00:02:32,003 --> 00:02:38,005
messages one more time all the way to the
way down to the end. And so, now again we

30
00:02:38,005 --> 00:02:43,093
are taking Delta 2-3, multiplying it with
psi 3 that comes from there. And that

31
00:02:43,093 --> 00:02:55,012
gives us a message over scope D which here
gets sent to cluster four. You could also

32
00:02:55,012 --> 00:02:59,085
pass messages in the other direction. So
this for example, would be what would

33
00:02:59,085 --> 00:03:04,098
happen if we pass messages from cluster
four to cluster three, Regardless of when

34
00:03:04,098 --> 00:03:09,093
that message gets passed the, there is no
other messages that cluster four would

35
00:03:09,093 --> 00:03:14,065
multiply in when sending a message to
cluster three because, whether it got the

36
00:03:14,065 --> 00:03:19,048
message from three or not, its not going
to multiply that in because remember you

37
00:03:19,048 --> 00:03:24,055
only send the cluster message that doesn't
involve messages you received from it. And

38
00:03:24,055 --> 00:03:29,051
so in this case the message that you get
is the, is the sum over E of the factor of

39
00:03:29,051 --> 00:03:35,015
psi 4 which we get from here.
[sound], [sound] Passing messages in the

40
00:03:35,015 --> 00:03:42,074
other direction again, we see that the
message cluster three passes to cluster

41
00:03:42,074 --> 00:03:50,005
two which is delta 3-2, involved
psi 3 and this message over here.

42
00:03:50,005 --> 00:04:01,028
And, finally exactly the same idea these
are the messages that gets passed. [sound]

43
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:07,025
The one important property that you have
when you run message passing in the way

44
00:04:07,025 --> 00:04:12,024
that we just showed, is that somewhat
surprisingly relevant to what we've seen

45
00:04:12,024 --> 00:04:17,084
before, the resulting beliefs that you get
are correct. And let's convince ourselves

46
00:04:17,084 --> 00:04:23,016
of that, relative to cluster three and
so, in the order that we defined, cluster

47
00:04:23,016 --> 00:04:28,055
one passed delta 1-2 to cluster two, which
was then used to define delta 23, at the

48
00:04:28,055 --> 00:04:33,081
same time, we had delta 43 and so the
beliefs that we get here are the product

49
00:04:33,081 --> 00:04:40,070
of psi 3 times delta 2-3, times delta 4-3. Let's unpack each

50
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:48,033
of those messages. So, delta 2-3 as
we remember, was defined here. And so

51
00:04:48,033 --> 00:04:55,002
we're going to rewrite what delta 2-3 is as the summation over B, of

52
00:04:55,002 --> 00:05:02,026
psi 2, delta 1-2. And similarly we unpack
the Delta 4-3 to get, using this

53
00:05:02,026 --> 00:05:10,066
expression that we have over here. Right
there. Now we're going to do one further

54
00:05:10,066 --> 00:05:15,086
level of unpacking and we are going to
remind ourselves of what delta 1-2

55
00:05:15,086 --> 00:05:21,026
is, which is as defined over here and so
that gives us this expression over there.

56
00:05:21,026 --> 00:05:28,037
And now look at what we have. We have a
product of all four initial factors in the

57
00:05:28,037 --> 00:05:35,031
network; psi 1, psi 2, psi 3 and psi 4.
We have a summation over

58
00:05:35,031 --> 00:05:42,050
all, the variables that are not in cluster
three, which are A, B and E. C and D are

59
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:49,027
in that cluster. So we sum out
over everything else. So already we see

60
00:05:49,027 --> 00:06:04,016
that we have a product of factors.
Marginalized out. Well, we marginalized out

61
00:06:04,016 --> 00:06:14,083
irrelevant variables or unnecessary
variables. Well this is really reminiscent

62
00:06:14,083 --> 00:06:19,088
of variable elimination. And, if you
recall we talked about the correctness of

63
00:06:19,088 --> 00:06:25,005
variable elimination. We said that
variable elimination is correct as long as

64
00:06:25,005 --> 00:06:30,055
you, as when you sent out a variable you
first multiply in all factors that relate

65
00:06:30,055 --> 00:06:35,074
to it. That involve the variable in their
scope. So lets convince ourselves that,

66
00:06:35,074 --> 00:06:41,019
that is in fact what's going on here. So
lets look first at the variable E. And

67
00:06:41,019 --> 00:06:46,052
when we sum out E, we're multiplying, we
only are, we're only involving psi 4,

68
00:06:46,052 --> 00:06:53,018
but that's okay because only the cluster
four has E in its scope. Here we are

69
00:06:53,018 --> 00:07:02,083
summing out A. And once again, only psi 1 involves, involves A in its scope.

70
00:07:02,083 --> 00:07:07,082
Here we're summing out B. And really,
there should be parentheses here. They

71
00:07:07,082 --> 00:07:13,014
were there implicitly before and so you
can see that when I'm summing out B of

72
00:07:13,014 --> 00:07:18,080
involved psi 2, which involves B in its
scope. As well as what was left over from

73
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:24,046
summing out psi 1 which is the other factor
that B in its scope. And so can see that

74
00:07:24,046 --> 00:07:29,051
I've marginalized out the variables in a
legal order, multiplying in only the

75
00:07:29,051 --> 00:07:34,057
expression, multiplying in all of the
expressions that I needed to multiply

76
00:07:34,057 --> 00:07:43,033
before I did this summation. And so this is a legal order of operations. And

77
00:07:43,033 --> 00:07:52,031
therefore. It gives me a correct result at
the end. So, now lets expand that into a

78
00:07:52,031 --> 00:07:58,053
somewhat broader into a somewhat broader
case. We're now going to define this notion

79
00:07:58,053 --> 00:08:04,017
called, The Clique Tree. And, a clique
tree is an undirected tree, kind of like a

80
00:08:04,017 --> 00:08:10,002
cluster graph was an undirected graph. So,
in this case, it's a tree. Such that, once

81
00:08:10,002 --> 00:08:16,014
again, the nodes are clusters. And once
again we have edges between the clusters

82
00:08:16,014 --> 00:08:22,050
which are called sepsets and in this case
where as before we had the sepset needed

83
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:28,064
to be a, only a subset of Ci intersection
Cj it could be smaller, it could be equal

84
00:08:28,064 --> 00:08:34,093
or it could be smaller. Here we are going
to require that the sepset is actually the

85
00:08:34,093 --> 00:08:41,072
intersection of the two adjacent
clusters. So now let's go and

86
00:08:41,072 --> 00:08:48,039
understand what properties the cluster,
the clique tree that we showed has as a

87
00:08:48,039 --> 00:08:54,067
special case of a cluster graph. So for a
cluster graph, we had the notion of family

88
00:08:54,067 --> 00:09:00,089
preservation. And the reason that we had
family preservation is because if we have

89
00:09:00,089 --> 00:09:06,026
a set of factors Phi, we needed to take
each phi k in Phi. And we needed to

90
00:09:06,026 --> 00:09:11,063
assign it to some cluster so that, so that
each piece of information that we have is

91
00:09:11,063 --> 00:09:16,044
represented somewhere. And the factor
needed to be such that the cluster could

92
00:09:16,044 --> 00:09:21,062
accommodate its scope, so that the scope
of the factor was a subset of the set of

93
00:09:21,062 --> 00:09:26,041
variables in a cluster. And the same
requirement holds here because

94
00:09:26,041 --> 00:09:31,017
a clique tree is a special case of the cluster
graph. So that we have that for every

95
00:09:31,017 --> 00:09:36,031
factor Phi K, there must exist at least one cluster whose scope is big enough to

96
00:09:36,031 --> 00:09:42,013
accommodate that factor. The second
property that we had in cluster graphs was

97
00:09:42,013 --> 00:09:47,013
the running intersection property. And
then, we clarified that the property that

98
00:09:47,013 --> 00:09:52,070
we see here is the cluster graph variant.
We're going to make it. Specific to clique

99
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:58,075
trees in just a minute. So the cluster
graph variant told me before, that for

100
00:09:58,075 --> 00:10:04,081
each pair of clusters, Ci and Cj, and a
variable X that is present in both of

101
00:10:04,081 --> 00:10:11,011
them, there needed to exist a path between
Ci and Cj, for which all clusters and

102
00:10:11,011 --> 00:10:17,041
sepsets contain X, and needs to be unique.
So what does that mean in the context of

103
00:10:17,041 --> 00:10:23,057
clique trees? Let's assume that we have C7
containing X, and C6 containing X. And the

104
00:10:23,057 --> 00:10:29,042
cluster, and the running intersection
property says that there needs to exist a

105
00:10:29,042 --> 00:10:35,065
path between them, for which, all clusters
and sepsets contain X. Well, there's only

106
00:10:35,065 --> 00:10:43,017
one path in a tree between C7 and C3, it's
this one. And so what that property now

107
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:48,017
tells me is that X has to be here, here,
here and here. Because the running,

108
00:10:48,017 --> 00:10:53,037
otherwise the running intersection
property is going to be violated in this

109
00:10:53,037 --> 00:10:59,070
case. So that means that in the context of
trees, the running intersection property

110
00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:05,078
can actually be written much more simply.
It can, it can be read as saying that for

111
00:11:05,078 --> 00:11:11,042
each pair of clusters Ci and Cj, and a
variable X in their intersection. Each

112
00:11:11,064 --> 00:11:17,050
cluster and sepset in the unique path
between them must contain X. And so this

113
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:23,073
is the just the instantiation of running
intersection property to the context of

114
00:11:23,073 --> 00:11:29,086
clique trees. So now, let's look at a, a
more complicated clique tree. This is the

115
00:11:29,086 --> 00:11:34,097
clique tree, that rep-, corresponds to the
network that we previously used to

116
00:11:34,097 --> 00:11:40,013
demonstrate variable elimination. This is
the elaboration of our student network.

117
00:11:40,013 --> 00:11:44,086
And so this is, unlike the previous
example, this is actually a, a clique tree

118
00:11:44,086 --> 00:11:49,084
for a Bayesian network, as opposed to a
Markov network. But as you'll see, there's

119
00:11:49,084 --> 00:11:55,049
really no difference. So here we have set
of factors. In this case the factors are

120
00:11:55,049 --> 00:12:00,031
CPD, and because of the family
preservation property we can be assured

121
00:12:00,031 --> 00:12:06,010
that each factor, must be assignable to
some clique. And so here we have, P of C,

122
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:11,067
and P of D given C are assigned to this
clique, P of G given I D, P of I, and

123
00:12:11,067 --> 00:12:17,065
P of S given I, and so on and so forth. So
each of the CPD's we have is assigned to

124
00:12:17,065 --> 00:12:23,014
one and exactly one of the cliques in this
clique tree. And we can convince

125
00:12:23,014 --> 00:12:29,012
ourselves, and we can convince ourselves
that this tree satisfies, for example, the

126
00:12:29,012 --> 00:12:34,074
running intersection property. So let's
look, for example, at the variable G. The

127
00:12:34,074 --> 00:12:40,000
variable G exists here, it exists here.
And sure enough, it exists here, here,

128
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,020
here, here, and here. And you can
similarly convince yourselves of that for

129
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:50,061
any of the other variable in this clique
tree, that the running intersection

130
00:12:50,061 --> 00:12:58,085
property holds for that. Let's look at what
message passing looks like for this more

131
00:12:58,085 --> 00:13:05,062
elaborate clique tree. So it's a little
bit only a slight bit more complicated. So

132
00:13:05,062 --> 00:13:12,029
here we have, for example, delta. So it's
not even that much more complicated. So

133
00:13:12,029 --> 00:13:17,051
here is delta 2-3, for example. And delta
2-3, which is the cluster between, which

134
00:13:17,051 --> 00:13:22,073
is the message passed between cluster two and
cluster three. Takes psi 2, which is

135
00:13:22,073 --> 00:13:27,087
the product of the factors assigned to
this clique. Actually, there's only

136
00:13:27,087 --> 00:13:32,069
one in this case, so it's only P of G
given I and D. So that's psi 2.

137
00:13:32,069 --> 00:13:38,042
Multiplies it with the incoming message,
delta 1-2, and sums out over D. The only

138
00:13:38,042 --> 00:13:43,058
slight difference between this and the
previous example that we have is that here

139
00:13:43,058 --> 00:13:48,093
for example, when cluster four passes the
message to cluster three, we can see that

140
00:13:48,093 --> 00:13:54,015
over here there is two variables, J and L,
both of which must be summed out in order

141
00:13:54,015 --> 00:14:02,058
to produce the message over the requisite
subsection. Now, we [inaudible], we

142
00:14:02,058 --> 00:14:08,002
defined the running intersection property,
one of the really nice aspects of the

143
00:14:08,002 --> 00:14:12,095
running intersection property is that it,
by itself together with family

144
00:14:12,095 --> 00:14:17,061
preservation, suffices to prove the
correctness of message passing in a

145
00:14:17,061 --> 00:14:27,079
clique tree. And the reason for that is
the following. If so let's consider a

146
00:14:27,079 --> 00:14:42,097
variable X over here. And let's and what
we want to prove is that Is that if we

147
00:14:42,097 --> 00:14:49,013
eliminate X at some point in the tree, at
some point in the message passing process,

148
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:55,081
then we have multiplied in all factors
that involve X. And, so here we have for

149
00:14:55,081 --> 00:15:02,035
example X here and here. And by the
running intersection property, we have that

150
00:15:02,035 --> 00:15:10,017
X is here and here as well, and on the
sepsets. And let's imagine that X is

151
00:15:10,017 --> 00:15:19,026
eliminated on this edge. That is, the
message that's passed from C3 to C5

152
00:15:20,025 --> 00:15:28,050
Doesn't, The message that passes thru C3
5o C5 doesn't involve X, so X must be summed

153
00:15:28,051 --> 00:15:42,016
out at this point. Well at this point we
know that X cannot. Be here. Because if X

154
00:15:42,016 --> 00:15:51,040
were in C-5, then it would also be in the
sepset. If, X in C-5 then X is also in

155
00:15:51,040 --> 00:16:04,098
S-3-5, at which point, X wouldn't be
eliminated. And the reason you know that

156
00:16:04,098 --> 00:16:09,021
if X is in C five, then X is in S three
five is because of the running

157
00:16:09,021 --> 00:16:14,088
intersection property. So the running
intersection property relates the

158
00:16:14,088 --> 00:16:21,010
structure of the graph to the structure,
to the time that those variables are

159
00:16:21,010 --> 00:16:31,023
eliminated. So now let's convince
ourselves of the correctness in this

160
00:16:31,023 --> 00:16:37,068
slightly more complicated example that,
that we've seen satisfies the running

161
00:16:37,068 --> 00:16:45,003
intersection property. Here once again, we
have psi 1. Which is the product of

162
00:16:45,003 --> 00:16:51,094
these two factors. Psi 2 which is this
one. Psi 3 which is these, the

163
00:16:51,094 --> 00:17:00,043
product of these two factors. Psi 4.
Psi 5. And once again, let's for

164
00:17:00,043 --> 00:17:08,068
example consider what we get at cluster
three. And you can see that we have

165
00:17:08,068 --> 00:17:17,059
multiplied in all of the potential, psi 1,
psi 2, psi 3, psi 4

166
00:17:17,059 --> 00:17:27,049
and psi 5. And that we have
eliminated all of the variable except for

167
00:17:27,049 --> 00:17:36,092
GSI so here we had eliminated C, D, J, L
and H, leaving us only with the variables

168
00:17:36,092 --> 00:17:43,080
G, S, I, which we want to keep. And we can
similarly convince ourselves, as we

169
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:50,042
did before, that when we eliminate a
variable, we've multiplied in all of the

170
00:17:50,042 --> 00:17:58,054
factors that involve that variable. So to
summarize, we can take belief

171
00:17:58,054 --> 00:18:04,005
propagation and run it over a cluster
graph that happens to be tree structured.

172
00:18:04,005 --> 00:18:09,035
And, when we do that, it turns out that
the computation that we're running is

173
00:18:09,035 --> 00:18:14,002
actually a variant of variable
elimination. And, because of that, the

174
00:18:14,002 --> 00:18:19,074
resulting beliefs are guaranteed not only
to be calibrated but to actually be the

175
00:18:19,074 --> 00:18:23,085
correct marginals of the un-normalized
density, P tilde Phi.
