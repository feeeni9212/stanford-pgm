1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,098
So, we previously talked about the
importance of allowing CPD

2
00:00:05,098 --> 00:00:10,097
representations that encode additional
structure in the local dependency model

3
00:00:10,097 --> 00:00:16,029
of a variable on it's parents. And we
talked about the cases are tree CPD's

4
00:00:16,029 --> 00:00:21,094
which allow us to depend on different
variables in different context. But none

5
00:00:21,094 --> 00:00:28,002
of that helps us deal with the situation
that we use as a motivation for this which

6
00:00:28,002 --> 00:00:33,046
is where we have a variable such, as for
example, cough that depends on multiple

7
00:00:33,046 --> 00:00:37,092
different factors: pneumonia, flu,
tuberculosis, bronchitis, and so on and so

8
00:00:37,092 --> 00:00:42,098
forth. This doesn't lend itself say to a
tree CPD because it's not the case that

9
00:00:42,098 --> 00:00:47,099
you depend on one only in certain context
and not and not in others. Really you

10
00:00:47,099 --> 00:00:53,023
depend on all of them and all of them sort
of contribute something to the probability

11
00:00:53,023 --> 00:00:58,068
of exhibiting a cough. So, one way for
capturing that kind of interaction is

12
00:00:58,068 --> 00:01:04,051
a model called the noisy OR CPD.
And the noisy a noisy OR [CPD] can, is best

13
00:01:04,051 --> 00:01:10,050
understood by simply considering, a
slightly larger graphical model, where we

14
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:16,056
have, where we're trying, where we break
down the dependencies of Y on its

15
00:01:16,056 --> 00:01:22,039
parents, X1 up to XK, by introducing a
bunch of intervening variables. So let's

16
00:01:22,039 --> 00:01:29,093
imagine that this is, again, like cough
variable. And this is different diseases,

17
00:01:29,093 --> 00:01:38,048
for example. And what we're doing here is
we're introducing an intermediate variable

18
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:46,014
that captures the event that this disease
X1, if present, causes a cough by itself. So,

19
00:01:46,014 --> 00:01:57,032
this is X1 by itself causes a cough or
causes Y. You can think of it,

20
00:01:57,032 --> 00:02:03,051
each of these as a noisy transmitter. If
you have the disease, say, if X1 is true,

21
00:02:03,051 --> 00:02:09,069
then Z1 sort of says, fine, X1
succeeded in it's intent to make Y true.

22
00:02:10,053 --> 00:02:20,010
X2 has it's own little filter called Z2.
And Z2 makes that same decision relative

23
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:29,050
to X2. And so, ultimately, Y is true. So Y
is true if, someone succeeded in making it true,

24
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:45,029
which means that Y is a deterministic OR of its parents Z1 up to Zk,

25
00:02:45,029 --> 00:02:52,000
Z0 up to Zk. So, now let's make this a
little bit more precise. So, the

26
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:59,017
probability of Zi being true given Xi. There's two cases. If Xi equals zero, well

27
00:02:59,017 --> 00:03:06,097
Xi isn't even trying to make Zi true. So in
this case the probability of Zi equals one

28
00:03:06,097 --> 00:03:16,061
is zero. If Xi is not true, Zi doesn't get turned on, ever. If Z, if

29
00:03:16,061 --> 00:03:22,027
Xi is true, then there's some probability
for Zi to get turned on. And that

30
00:03:22,027 --> 00:03:28,054
probability is something called Lambda i.
And Lambda i is in the interval [0,1]. And you

31
00:03:28,054 --> 00:03:34,088
can think of it as defining some kind of
penetrance of, how good is Xi at turning Y

32
00:03:34,088 --> 00:03:43,035
on? So if we actually write this down as a
probability and we just consider the CPD of

33
00:03:43,035 --> 00:03:49,081
Y equals zero, so why doesn't get turned
on, given some set of cases X1 up to Xk.

34
00:03:49,081 --> 00:03:55,077
So now we're asking, what is the
probablity that all of these guys failed

35
00:03:55,077 --> 00:04:02,014
to turn on the variable Y? So, what I forgot to say is that Z0 is what's called a

36
00:04:02,014 --> 00:04:09,024
leak probability and that's the probablity
that Y gets turned on just by itself. And

37
00:04:09,024 --> 00:04:15,041
that has, that happens when probability
lands to zero. So, when does Y fail to get

38
00:04:15,041 --> 00:04:21,019
turned on? First of all, when it doesn't
get turned on by the leak. So

39
00:04:21,019 --> 00:04:27,006
that's one minus [inaudible] to zero.
Times, the probability that none of the

40
00:04:27,006 --> 00:04:35,044
causes that are on, so none of causes
that are on. Which are the x size that are

41
00:04:35,044 --> 00:04:42,063
equal to one turn Y on. And so, that's a
product of one minus Lambda i for all of

42
00:04:42,063 --> 00:04:48,062
the XI's that are on. So, that gives us
the probability of Y equals one. And

43
00:04:48,062 --> 00:04:54,076
obviously the probability of Y equals
one is just the compliment of that. One

44
00:04:54,076 --> 00:05:06,074
minus. Sorry, this should be zero. But, since the noisy OR

45
00:05:06,074 --> 00:05:12,075
CPD, and you can generalize this to a
much broader notion of independence of

46
00:05:12,075 --> 00:05:17,069
causal influence. This is called
independence of causal influence, because

47
00:05:17,069 --> 00:05:22,089
it assumes that you have a bunch of causes
for a variable, and each of them acts

48
00:05:22,089 --> 00:05:27,096
independently to affect the truth of that
variable. So, there's no interactions

49
00:05:27,096 --> 00:05:32,097
between the different causes. They each
have their own separate mechanism, and

50
00:05:32,097 --> 00:05:38,043
ultimately, it's all aggregated together
in, in a single, in a single variable, z,

51
00:05:38,043 --> 00:05:44,002
from which the truth of y is then, is then
determined from this aggregate effect of

52
00:05:44,002 --> 00:05:49,031
all of the, All of these [inaudible] ZIs
of the different causes. So, one example

53
00:05:49,031 --> 00:05:54,032
of this is, we've already seen the noisy
[inaudible]. But you easily generalize

54
00:05:54,032 --> 00:05:59,002
this to a broad range of other cases.
There's noisy [inaudible], where the

55
00:05:59,002 --> 00:06:04,029
aggregation function is and, and. There's
noisy maxes, which apply in the non binary

56
00:06:04,029 --> 00:06:09,050
case, when causes might not just be turned
on or off, but rather, different sort of

57
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:14,099
extensive being turned on. And then Z is
actually sort of the maximal extent. Of,

58
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:21,024
of. Of the being independent effect of
this cause and so on. So there is a large

59
00:06:21,024 --> 00:06:25,089
range of different models, all of which
fits into this family. [inaudible],

60
00:06:25,089 --> 00:06:30,093
probably the one most commonly used but
the other ones have been used in other

61
00:06:30,093 --> 00:06:37,013
settings as well. One model that might not
immediately be seen to fit into this

62
00:06:37,013 --> 00:06:43,025
framework but actually does is a model
that corresponds to the sigmoid CPD. So

63
00:06:43,025 --> 00:06:51,020
what's a sigmoid CPD? A [inaudible] CPD
says that each XI induces a continuous

64
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:59,031
variable which represents WI-XI. So
imagine if each XI is discreet. Then ZI is

65
00:06:59,031 --> 00:07:06,089
just a continuous value WI, which
parameterizes this edge. And it tell us,

66
00:07:06,089 --> 00:07:15,049
sort of, how much force, XI is going to
exert on making Y true. So if WI is zero,

67
00:07:15,049 --> 00:07:21,063
it tells us that XI exerts no influence
whatsoever. If WI is positive, XY is going

68
00:07:21,063 --> 00:07:28,001
to make, Y, more likely to be true. And if
WI is negative, it's going to make Y less

69
00:07:28,001 --> 00:07:34,046
likely to be true. All of these influences
are aggregated together in this expression

70
00:07:34,046 --> 00:07:40,083
for the variable Z, which effectively adds
up all of these different insolences, plus

71
00:07:40,083 --> 00:07:47,044
an additional bias term. W. Zero. And now
we need to turn this ultimately into the

72
00:07:47,044 --> 00:07:55,030
probability of the variable Y., which is
the variable that we care about. And in

73
00:07:55,030 --> 00:08:00,074
order to do that, what we're going to do
is we're going to pass this continuous

74
00:08:00,074 --> 00:08:06,031
quantity z, which is real number between
negative infinity and infinity, through a

75
00:08:06,031 --> 00:08:11,082
Sigmoid function. The Sigmoid function is
defined as follows, and it's a function

76
00:08:11,082 --> 00:08:17,054
that, some of you have seen in the context
of machine learning, for example. So

77
00:08:17,054 --> 00:08:23,012
Sigmoid takes the variable, the value, the
continuous value z, exponentiates it, and

78
00:08:23,012 --> 00:08:28,081
then divides one plus that exponent of z,
and Since E. Of Z., since E. To the power

79
00:08:28,081 --> 00:08:34,041
of Z. Is a positive number, this gives us
a number that is always an interval of 01.

80
00:08:35,072 --> 00:08:43,064
And if we look at what this function looks
like. It looks like this, so this is the

81
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:51,060
Sigmoid function. The X. Axis here is, the
value Z., and the Y. Axis is the Sigmoid

82
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:59,056
function. And you can see that as'z' gets
very negative the probability goes to

83
00:08:59,056 --> 00:09:04,088
zero. As'z' gets very high the probability
gets close to one and there is this

84
00:09:04,088 --> 00:09:11,097
interval in the middle where intermediate
values are taken. You can, so this is kind

85
00:09:11,097 --> 00:09:18,098
of like a squelching function that, that
sort of squashes the function on both

86
00:09:18,098 --> 00:09:26,050
ends. Let's look at the behavior of the
Sigmoid C. P. D. As a function of

87
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:32,084
different parameters. So here is a case
where all of the X. Sides have the same

88
00:09:32,084 --> 00:09:39,038
parameter W. And, so what we see here is
the value of this parameter w and over

89
00:09:39,038 --> 00:09:45,058
here is the number of xi that are true.
So, let's look at first this axis over

90
00:09:45,058 --> 00:09:52,076
here. The more parents that are true, the
more parents that are on the higher. The

91
00:09:52,076 --> 00:09:58,082
probability of Y to be true, okay? And
this holds for any value of W, because

92
00:09:58,082 --> 00:10:05,004
these are all positive influences, okay?
So the more parents are true, the more

93
00:10:05,004 --> 00:10:11,066
things are pushing Y to take, the value
true. This axis over here is the axis of

94
00:10:11,066 --> 00:10:18,004
the weight. And we can see this, for low
weights, you need an awful lot of X's to

95
00:10:18,004 --> 00:10:24,027
get Y to be true. But as W increases, Y
becomes true with a lot fewer positive

96
00:10:24,027 --> 00:10:32,059
influences. This graph on the right now.
Is what we get when we basically just

97
00:10:32,059 --> 00:10:37,068
increase the amplitude of the whole
system. We mulitply both W and W0 by a

98
00:10:37,068 --> 00:10:43,019
factor of ten. And what happens is that,
that means that the exponent gets pushed

99
00:10:43,019 --> 00:10:48,097
up through extreme values much quicker. Z
gets effectively multiplied by a factor of

100
00:10:48,097 --> 00:10:54,058
ten. And that means that the transition
becomes considerably sharper. That gives

101
00:10:54,058 --> 00:10:58,086
us a little bit of an intuition on how the
[inaudible] function and how the

102
00:10:58,086 --> 00:11:06,045
[inaudible] CBD behaves. So what are some
examples of this kind of a, this kind of a

103
00:11:06,067 --> 00:11:12,033
an a application of this. So, I showed
this network on an earlier part of this

104
00:11:12,033 --> 00:11:18,072
course. It's the CPS network and it's used
for the, it was developed for the Stanford

105
00:11:18,072 --> 00:11:24,038
Medical School, for the diagnosis of
internal diseases and, so, up here we have

106
00:11:24,038 --> 00:11:30,088
things that represent pre disposing
factors. And there is actually a fairly

107
00:11:30,088 --> 00:11:36,056
eclectic range here. So, for example, one
predisposing factor is intimate contact

108
00:11:36,056 --> 00:11:41,095
with small rodents, 'cause that's the
contributing factor at the [inaudible]

109
00:11:41,095 --> 00:11:47,063
virus. And so there's a whole range of
predisposing factors. Down here, in the

110
00:11:47,063 --> 00:11:54,013
middle, we have the [inaudible]. And down
at the bottom we have symptoms and test

111
00:11:54,013 --> 00:12:05,050
results. Now, as I previously mentioned,
there is approximately 500, variables in

112
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:11,098
this network. And they take an average
about four values. So the total number of

113
00:12:11,098 --> 00:12:20,000
entries in a joined distribution [sound]
over this space would be. Approximately

114
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:25,088
four to the 500 are different parameters,
which is clearly, an attractable number.

115
00:12:25,088 --> 00:12:30,083
If we were to take this network, and just,
if we take this distribution

116
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:36,035
representative using the network shown in
this diagram, we get considerable

117
00:12:36,035 --> 00:12:44,036
sparsification, and the [inaudible] form.
Has approximately, 134,000,000,

118
00:12:44,036 --> 00:12:53,058
parameters, which is still much too many,
to have a human estimate. By using, as in

119
00:12:53,058 --> 00:13:00,007
this case they use a noisy Max. Cpd. They
brought out the number of parameters to

120
00:13:00,007 --> 00:13:05,047
about 8,000 total parameters, to this net
worth which is a much more attractable

121
00:13:05,047 --> 00:13:06,077
number to deal with.
