function C = FactorSum(A, B)
% C = FactorProduct(A,B) computes the sum of two factors, A and B.
% The code here is highly adapted from the FactorProduct function by Prof.
% Daphne Koller.

% Check for empty factors
if (isempty(A.var)), C = B; return; end;
if (isempty(B.var)), C = A; return; end;

% Check that variables in both A and B have the same cardinality
[dummy iA iB] = intersect(A.var, B.var);
if ~isempty(dummy)
	% A and B have at least 1 variable in common
	assert(all(A.card(iA) == B.card(iB)), 'Dimensionality mismatch in factors');
end

% Set the variables of C
C.var = union(A.var, B.var);

[~, mapA] = ismember(A.var, C.var);
[~, mapB] = ismember(B.var, C.var);

% Set the cardinality of variables in C
C.card = zeros(1, length(C.var));
C.card(mapA) = A.card;
C.card(mapB) = B.card;

% Initialize the factor values of C:
%   prod(C.card) is the number of entries in C
C.val = zeros(1,prod(C.card));

% Compute some helper indices
% These will be very useful for calculating C.val
% so make sure you understand what these lines are doing.
assignments = IndexToAssignment(1:prod(C.card), C.card);
indxA = AssignmentToIndex(assignments(:, mapA), A.card);
indxB = AssignmentToIndex(assignments(:, mapB), B.card);

C.val = A.val(indxA) + B.val(indxB);
